# CUFindIt

CUFindIt is a revolutionary mobile application developed to aid students in finding their lost items. Users of the app who find items may add an entry to the 
collection, adding information such as the name, its category (options displayed to user), and the location where it was found. Students who have lost item(s) may 
scroll through the entries that other people have added and click on any that look familiar to them. They see a page with the information about the item that was
added before, as well as the net ID of the person who found it. If the user believes the item is theirs, they can click the "claim" button. The entry subsequently 
becomes grayed out and displays the net ID of the user who claimed the item when one taps on it. Claimed items show up in the user's profile page. 

We also have some special features. We implemented haptics so that the device vibrates every time he or she claims an item. The movement of the add button was 
integrated in a way that would smoothly transition with the scroll. Our tab view controller is also a state of the art product.
